LV 9 (SPEND 1 rupee)

Notes:

Bad:
can skip boomerang, wasn't useful, saves several screens
get more keys from level 2 while getting flute
Lv 4 - pay life instead of money, costs some time, but saves the need to grind any rupees
get 1 more key to avoid having to buy one before level 9

Good:
going from level 5 to 6 -> raft glitch, plus already having the flute enabled -> a lot of time saved
Lv 7 - leave life, uses no frames compared to rupees, no need to get rupees, if 3 hearts, just lose health
