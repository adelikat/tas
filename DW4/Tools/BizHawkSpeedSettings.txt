BizHawk Speed Settings
Turn off rewind
File -> Movie -> Backup movies -> false (maybe not that helpful)
Config -> Rewind & States ->
	Backups savestates -> false (lua api uses this, if we do a saved numbered state)
	MovieCompressionLevel 1 (set only in config), this was tested at 16k input frames, likely this needs to be changed as the movie size increases?
Sounds -> enable
		  volume down
Config -> speed/skip -> audio throttle
