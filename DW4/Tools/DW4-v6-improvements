Improvements

General improvements
The most embarrassing oversight of the previous TAS and the main motivation to redo the TAS, did not know that the day/night counter can randomly not advance when walking.  Due to this, some extra steps were done in key moments where waiting for night was necessary

Transitions have a variable number of lag frames.  Another oversight that I did not discover until near the end of the previous TAS, by then I decided to leave as is, since it is just a few frames.  Those frames add up, however, and another big motivation to make this improvement

Chapter 1
Staying at the Inn at the beginning of the game sets the day/night counter to 40 instead of 0, saving about 3 seconds due to not having to walk around Izmut waiting for night time

Insane manipulation on stats, knowing that Ragnar does not need any stats as he is killed off in chapter 5 without contributing with any attacks.  It doubly saves time to skip HP since it makes it faster when killing him off, as I only need a regular attack (citation needed)
